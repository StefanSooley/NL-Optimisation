To calculate each successive x vector iteratively, the formula: x_new = x + alpha * d is used.
This will continue until the norm of d is less than a tolerance.
Each d is calculated using: d_new = beta * d - g,
where beta is calculated using the Polak-Ribiere formula.
Alpha is approximated using a line search algorithm to minimise the function f(x + alpha*d). 


1)
In the first step, the seed vector x0 was [0.5 0.5 0.5], and d was simply the negative of the gradient
resulting in d = [1. 3. 5.]. The new x vector is given by the equation x = x + alpha * d, 

The resulting x vector is [0.62857242 1.88571726 3.1428621 ].


2)
The calculated beta value is: 0.019593820419638006,
making d [ 0.76244898  0.28734694 -0.1877551 ].
The alpha value found using line search minimisation is: 0.6285724204119332

Using these values, the resulting x vector is [1.00247014 2.02662946 3.05078879]

Since the calculated norm of d is higher than the tolerance, another iteration is required.

3)
The calculated beta value is: -1.7199916617462479e-06,
making d [-0.0049416  -0.05325942 -0.10157725].
The alpha value found using line search minimisation is: 0.49039048106633015

Using these values, the resulting x vector is [0.99999935 1.99999979 3.00000023]

Since the calculated norm of d is higher than the tolerance, another iteration is required.

4)
The calculated beta value is: -1.4071664215144284e-06,
making d [ 1.31140588e-06  4.94234233e-07 -3.22937411e-07].
The alpha value found using line search minimisation is: 0.4999992964158013

Using these values, the resulting x vector is [1.         2.00000004 3.00000007]

Since the calculated norm of d is higher than the tolerance, another iteration is required.

5)
The calculated beta value is: 1.372153548980554e-06,
making d [-6.95369406e-09 -7.49448898e-08 -1.42936086e-07].
The alpha value found using line search minimisation is: 0.5000007035841987

Using these values, the resulting x vector is [1. 2. 3.]

Since the calculated norm of d is higher than the tolerance, another iteration is required.

6)
The calculated beta value is: 1.4048938254700739e-06,
making d [-1.79944872e-12 -6.78164694e-13  4.43119330e-13].
The alpha value found using line search minimisation is: 0.49965911673336355

Using these values, the resulting x vector is [1. 2. 3.]

Since the calculated norm of d is now below the tolerance, this x is the solution to the desired accuracy.
